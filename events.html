                            The Red Cross CPR training and Disaster Preparedness seminar held at FEU Roosevelt Cainta was an engaging and insightful experience for everyone involved. The seminar began with discussions led by Red Cross representatives who highlighted the importance of readiness and presence of mind during emergencies. They explained how preparedness can greatly reduce panic and damage during disasters like earthquakes, typhoons, and fires. The session also emphasized the role of individuals in promoting safety within their communities and the value of knowing basic life-saving techniques such as CPR.
                            During the CPR training portion, participants learned how to perform Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation through a creative and resourceful approach—using water gallons as mannequins. Even without actual CPR dummies, the instructors demonstrated proper hand placement, compression depth, and rhythm, allowing everyone to simulate the procedure effectively. This improvisation made the activity both fun and educational, showing that life-saving skills can be practiced with available materials. The experience helped participants understand the importance of timing, pressure, and confidence when performing CPR in real-life situations.
